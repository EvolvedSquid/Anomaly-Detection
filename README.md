# Anomoly-Detection
Detecting anomalies in the MNIST fashion dataset using an autoencoder in Keras.

This project trains an autoencoder on the MNIST fashion dataset, then sorts images by loss.  Examples that are encoded the worst may, in theory, be anomalies to the dataset.  In practice for images, these "anomalies" tend to be brightly stripped pieces of clothing.
